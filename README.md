# Class-Extends-Inheritence
Classes: Classes in TypeScript provide a blueprint for creating objects with properties and methods. They encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit.

 Extends (Inheritance): Inheritance in TypeScript allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass). The subclass can then extend or override the functionality of the superclass.

 Implements (Implementation): Implementing interfaces in TypeScript allows a class to adhere to a contract specified by an interface. It ensures that the class has all the properties and methods defined in the interface.
